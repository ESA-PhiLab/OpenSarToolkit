    "This notebook provides an introduction to the batch processing of Sentinel-1 GRD data using OST's *Sentinel1Batch* class. This is a subclass of the *Sentinel1* class, and thus inherits all the functionalities of the *Generic* and the *Sentinel1* classes for the generation of a project as well as data search and refinement as presented in the OST Tutorial II notebook. The *Sentinel1Batch* class holds functions for the batch processing of single calibrated backscatter products. Furthermore, time-series processing and the generation of multi-temporal statistics, referred to as timescans, are introduced. \n",

    "Within the given example, time-series for 4 different overlapping tracks are going to be produced over the city of Vienna, Austria. The notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the reduction of data processing by automatically subsetting the data,\n",
    "2. time-series processing and the corresponding ARD types,\n",
    "3. merging the track specific time-series into a unique time-series with almost daily coverage,  \n",

    "Similar to the *Sentinel1Scene* class (Tutorial I and III), the *Sentinel1Batch* class handles the defintion of ARD types in a hierarchical dictionary structure. You can use the same types and steps to customize as for the *Sentinel1Scene* class. For our example, we already intialised the class instance with the OST-RTC ARD type, in order to remove the backscatter distortion on mountainous slopes. This applies to all single image processing in the first step. The subsequent time-series processing will bring all the imagery to a common grid and apply a multitemporal speckle filter, that is much more efficient than speckle filtering applied on a single image. Since speckle filters a conceptionalised to work on the raw power data of SAR imagery, the conversion to the dB scale is only applied after the multi-temporal speckle filtering. In addition, all images are clipped to the very same extent, that is defined by the common data coverage of all images per track as well as the AOI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is possible to change the datatype of the output to either unsigned 16 or 8-bit integer. The backscatter data is therefore linearly stretched between -30 to 5 dB.
