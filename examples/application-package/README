The contents of this directory support testing of the OpenSarToolkit
CWL Workflow as an OGC EO Application Package. The JSON files
(which in a real deployment would be generated by the EOAP platform's
data stage-in process) provide a STAC catalogue for a specified input
item. The file input.yaml specifies the parameters for the workflow.
After setting the parameters appropriately in input.yaml, the workflow
can be executed in the manner of an Application Package by running

cwltool opensar.cwl inputs.cwl
